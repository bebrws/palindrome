# Implementing a Function to Validate a Whether or Not a String Is a Palindrome
## What is Palindrome?
A *palindrome* is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam or racecar. - [from WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome

## Specifics to Implementing isPalindrome
The *isPalindrome* function we would like to implement will strip or ignore all whitespaces and punctuation characters, ignore case, and then check if the string is a palindrome.

## Running the Test
To run the test, you can use the following command:
```
    npm run test
```
After running this command the desired output would be having a full list of:
```
    ✅ Passed
```
The lines:
```
    ❌ Failed
```
would be displayed if the test failed.
